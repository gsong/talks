# Words of Experience

* You don’t have to check your dotfiles into a source repository
* It's more of a philosophy: there’s no right or wrong way to do it
* Start simple and build up over time
* 🤐 **DO NOT** commit your secrets!

# How I Use This in Practice

* Daily: `brew-install && npm-install`
* Monthly: Upgrade Python & Ruby runtimes and packages, Vim plugins
* Ad-hoc: Make changes to configurations of various tools
