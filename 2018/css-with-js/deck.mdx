# 💅 Style With JavaScript 💅

## What About CSS?

* “Cascading” sounds nice, until it isn’t.
* Oh, did you want just a part of that style class? 🤣
* `<button class='button button-large button-primary button-disabled my-own-effect'>`
* Give up? `!important` 😓
* Responsive? But can it do [this][demo]?

## But, What About Sass, Less, BEM, and All the Other Wonderful CSS Frameworks?

* 🔮 We’re all mind readers!
* 🃏 House of cards: specificity, redundancy, conflicts, inefficient, error-prone.
* 🤢 **Punishes** customers and developers over time.

Declarative is great.

But not if you don’t have the imperative to back it up.

With CSS:

```
// *.css
.fancy-pants { background-color: blue; ... }
// *.html
<div class="fancy-pants">
```

With JS:

```js
// Component.js
const fancyPants = css({ backgroundColor: "blue", ... })
<div className={fancyPants}>
```

Renders:

```html
<style>
  .css-1xcezbh { background-color: blue; ... }
</style>
<div class="css-1xcezbh">
```
---
## Ok, So What

```js
import { isIE11 } from "utils/featureDetect";

const fancyPants = css({
  background-color: blue,
  display: isIE11 ? flex: grid
})

<div className={fancyPants}>
```

## 👭 Co-Locate Styling With Rendering

* Code splitting
* Focus on a single component
* Changing a single style doesn’t trigger a completely new bundle
---
## What’s Better?

* App build times
* Accessible design
* Component sharing
* Testing!
---
## What’s Harder?

* Think composition, not cascading
* Different ways of optimization
